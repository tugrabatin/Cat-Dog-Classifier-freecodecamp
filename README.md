### Cat-Dog Classification using Pytorch

This is a typical computer vision project in which pictures are classified as cat or dog. While the accuracy is the output, the major goal of this project is to learn how to utilize convolution neural networks (CNN) for classification using Pytorch rather than to achieve high accuracy.
